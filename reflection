It is an interesting project since I am a Bioinformatic student, I am enabled to learn about heart
disease and data analysis. This is a fresh experience to face a big data set and do statistical tests with
real-world data. There are also some factors that will increase the risk of heart disease, such as
smoking, alcohol consumption, eating habits and many more. Public health campaigns focusing on
lifestyle modifications could have a substantial impact on reducing the burden of heart diseases.
Lastly, my teammates are very cooperative and done their part within the time given.
